description: This deck is based around combining Xingqiu’s burst attacks with Ganyu’s Frostflake Arrow to freeze the enemies and deal huge AoE DMG in the process. After Xingqiu uses his Elemental Burst, it’s all a game of switching in Ganyu safely, dealing a lot of DMG, and then repeat next round. Keep in mind that fast swaps can counter this deck easily, so always make sure your Ganyu is safe from harm.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Elemental Resonance: Woven Waters', 'Liben', 'Liu Su', 'Paimon', 'Undivided Heart']"></CardRow>
In your mulligan, you want to look for some sort of early ramp like Liben/Paimon to make your Ganyu turn stronger, since the extra dice make a huge difference in what you can actually do. Undivided Heart is also an easy keep since it’s one of the more relevant cards in the deck, and you ideally always want it on Ganyu from the second Frostflake Arrow onwards. Lastly, Liu Su allows you to burst on Xingqiu on Round 1, which makes your second set up turn a lot easier and more flexible.  <br></br>

Obviously what you keep changes depending on your opponent’s deck, but cheap energy and ramp are things you want in every game. If you end up not getting them, your gameplan could be halted a bit. Same goes for Undivided Heart, which could limit your DMG output significantly.

 
### Other cards to keep
<CardFan :cards="['Chang the Ninth', 'The Bestest Travel Companion']"></CardFan>
If you already have some of your good early cards, you can consider keeping things like Chang the Ninth for some early draws, and he will easily trigger with Xingqiu’s Normal Attacks or when he cleanses himself with a Skill or Burst. If your hand is already really good, you can consider keeping dice fixing cards to make your early game a bit more consistent, although you would usually rather keep them for your Ganyu turns. 
### Getting Xingqiu’s Burst out safely.
Xingqiu’s Burst is a key component of your main combo, so you must make sure Xingqiu doesn’t die before casting it. Ideally, you want to do Normal Attacks to charge up Energy, and if the opponent applies an element on you, use your Elemental Skill to cleanse it as well as getting some DMG Reduction on top. If you have Liu Su in your opening hand, you instead want to start on Mona, play Liu Su, and then swap to Xingqiu to give him 1 Energy. You probably won’t use your Skill in this situation, but remember that your burst also cleanses elements from you. Additionally, you can also use Woven Waters to gain one extra hydro die and cast his Burst on Round 1 without swapping at all. Be mindful of units that can kill Xingqiu in the first round of the game, like Fatui Pyro Agent or Stonehide Lawachurl, since they can kill your key unit unless you decide to protect Xingqiu with additional resources, which you would rather save for Ganyu. 
 
## Ramping and setting up Ganyu
 After you cast Xingqiu’s burst, you should use the rest of your turn - or if you casted his Burst on Round 1, you could consider using your whole second round - to ramp up so that Ganyu can have as many dice as possible on her turns. This means playing cards like Liben or Paimon, equipping Gambler's on Ganyu if you have spare dice to use (assuming your Liben already has his dice, obviously), or even using a Skill on Mona for some good Hydro application without wasting Xingqiu’s Burst. Ideally, you want to end on Ganyu or Mona. However, ending on Mona is highly recommended since it’s not that huge of a problem if she takes DMG.

 
## Executing the Combo and closing out the game
Now that you have set up, it’s time for Ganyu to wreak havoc on your opponents. You want to fast swap to Ganyu using Mona’s passive, and then use a Frostflake Arrow. This will freeze the main opponent thanks to Xingqiu’s Burst, and deal some decent AoE DMG to the others, which becomes a lot stronger if Ganyu has Undivided Heart equipped. After each Frostflake Arrow, be careful of what your opponent can do: if they slow swap to another unit, you can Skill/Burst on Ganyu to freeze them and buy additional time - or even shoot a second Frostflake Arrow if you have enough dice for it- but always be mindful of a fast swap: if one fast swap would be enough to kill Ganyu, then either swap to Mona or play defensive cards or healing on Ganyu. If she dies, it’s probably game over for you: avoid that at all costs, unless you already have enough remaining DMG. Remember that letting Xingqiu die after his burst is active isn’t necessarily bad either: it allows you to swap to Ganyu for free, and even trigger I Haven’t Lost Yet! if you have it in hand. Lastly, remember that you can Normal Attack a frozen enemy to deal +2 extra DMG, which can close out games when the opponent is on their last unit.
