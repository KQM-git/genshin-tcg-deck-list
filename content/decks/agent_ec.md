## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Tubby', 'Liben', 'The Bestest Travel Companion!', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf'']"></CardRow>

Look for ramp and card draw that can be effectively utilized during the early stages of the game such as Liben, Tubby, Liyue Harbor Wharf, and Strategize. Dice fixers will also serve as effective tools to enhance the deck’s consistency, particularly when Dice rolls are unfavorable. Thus, It is recommended to keep The Bestest Travel Companion! if it appears during the mulligan phase. <br></br>

## Early Game
<CardRow :cards= "['Rhodeia of Loch', 'Fischl']"></CardRow>

In the initial round, prioritize applying pressure by using Rhodeia of Loch's Elemental Skill. Typically, you start by using Rhodeia of Loch’s 5-cost Elemental Skill to Summon your Oceanid Mimics, then use the remaining Dice towards playing ramp cards such as Liben, Tubby, or Liyue Harbor Wharf. In the case where you don't have any ramp cards to utilize your remaining Dice, alternatively use Rhodeia of Loch’s 3-cost Elemental Skill along with Fischl's Skill. The rule of thumb is having at least Oz and at least two Oceanid Mimics at the end of Round 2. <br></br>

## Mid - Late Game
<CardFan :cards= "['Lucky Dog\'s Silver Circlet', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet', 'Calx\'s Art']"></CardFan>

Prioritizing always having Summons on the field and using healing cards to stay out of your opponent’s breakpoints is your main strategy. While slowly generating Summon value, keep an eye on your energy, as cards such as Calx's Arts and I Haven't Lost Yet!, when combined with Adeptus' Temptation, can catch opponents off guard with an unexpected Elemental Burst on a crucial target. Fischl's Elemental Burst, Midnight Phantasmagoria, can deal significant AoE Damage to eliminate low-health standby characters. Whereas Rhodeia's Elemental Burst: Tide and Torrent is capable of unleashing up to 10 points of damage with four Summons on the field, which is enough to defeat a full-health character in one shot. <br></br>

### Fatui Pyro Agent
<CardRow :cards= "['Fatui Pyro Agent']"></CardRow>

Fatui Pyro Agent is capable of applying Pyro, setting up for a Vaporize or Overload reaction at the end of your turn when combined with your Summons. However, be careful to prevent Fatui Pyro Agent from taking too much damage, as you'll need them to secure victory in the later stages of the game. In end-game scenarios where it becomes a one-on-one situation, Fatui Pyro Agent is an exceptionally formidable unit, especially when equipped with Lucky Dog’s Circlet and their Talent Card Paid in Full, making them quite challenging to defeat. <br></br> 

## Tubby 
<CardRow :cards= "['Tubby', 'Sumeru City', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf']"></CardRow>

Tubby is a Companion Card that reduces the Dice cost of playing a Location Card by 2 every Round including the Round you play it. Be sure to place Tubby down as soon as possible to maximize the value of this effect! <br></br>

Sumeru City, costing 2 Dice, typically reduces the Dice cost of using a Skill by 1 each Round, provided you have equal or more cards in your Hand than Dice. However, when Tubby is on the board, you can play Sumeru City for a cost of 0 Dice while still receiving the 1 Dice cost reduction. This unique synergy allows Sumeru City to function like an unexpected Dice-saving card, catching opponents off guard. <br></br>

### Non-Tubby Variant

Although the Tubby engine delivers reliable performance within this deck, it is important to draw Tubby early in the game. Drawing Tubby later in the game can often diminish its effectiveness, leading to concerns about the deck's overall consistency. As a result, you can choose to adopt a more aggressive strategy by entirely removing both Tubby and healing Location Cards and replacing them with cards suggested in the alternative cards section. <br></br>

## Alternative cards 
<CardRow :cards= "['Yae Miko', 'Starsigns', 'Changing Shifts', 'Paimon', 'Send Off']"></CardRow>

This deck is pretty flexible when it comes to card choices. For instance, you have the option to substitute Fischl with Yae Miko. While Fischl has a more potent AoE Burst, Yae Miko provides a cheaper single-target focused Elemental Burst, albeit with the drawback of removing her Summon after the burst. Including Yae Miko in the deck also reduces the need for Energy Cards due to her Burst only requiring 2-Energy to cast compared to Fischl’s 3-Energy cost Burst. Furthermore, you can enhance the deck's ramp options by adding cards such as Paimon and Vanarana. For the more aggressive deck variant, consider adding cards like Changing Shifts for Dice reduction and Starsigns for instant Energy to snipe crucial units. Lastly, consider including Send Off to improve your matchup against other Summon-focused decks. <br></br>
