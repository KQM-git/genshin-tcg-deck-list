description: Deck based around eliminating an opponent's characters as early as possible to establish tempo and disrupt potential combos and counterplay. Such eliminations are possible as early as round one, and the advantage of forcing an early 2v3 can be back breaking for opponents without significant defensive counterplay or early ramp to counteract the dice advantage.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards="['The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Toss-Up', 'Liu Su', 'Paimon', 'Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames']"></CardRow>

What you mulligan for depends on the deck you’re up against, but generally, against all decks, aim to start with at least 1 dice fixer in my hand. A dice fixer is any card that allows you to manipulate your dice rolls. This is because you need a lot of identical dice on round 1 no matter your opener, and not getting them is basically an instant loss.  <br></br>

Despite this, I will consider keeping some non-dice fixing cards depending on the game. This is because cards you shuffle back in your deck during the first reroll will not appear again, meaning throwing a Paimon back in your deck guarantees that you’ll start without one, and you’re a lot more likely to draw a bad opener such as Lotus Crisp or I Haven't Lost Yet. Ramp becomes strong following your opening turn so keeping ramp cards is a very strong way to offset any potential dice related failings early and transition into a strong midgame. 

 
### Dice Fixing
<CardFan :cards="['The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Toss-Up', 'Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames']"></CardFan>
In addition to enabling you to avoid RNG related woes, dice fixers go a long way in giving your first turn more actions than your opponent, which can potentially result in removing an opponent's combo piece as early as the first round. Woven Flames gives you an additional pyro dice which is invaluable for the FTK combo.
 
### Ramp and Early Value
Cards like Liben, Paimon and Chang The Ninth allow you to sacrifice early dice for more on later turns, which is not your primary goal but stands as an acceptable backup plan if your first turn kill doesn't go off. In addition to the ramp cards, cards that have value early like Liu Su, and Changing Shifts are good to have as well. 
 
## Early Game Plan
There are multiple distinct FTK or setup lines with this deck.  
Mona Klee FTK (1-5-2-3):  
Mona Skill > Swap Klee > Klee Skill > Klee Charged  
Required cards: Woven Flames or Changing Shifts, Bestest/Tossup  
<br></br>
Agent FTK (3-2-5):  
Agent NA > Agent Skill/NA > Agent Burst   
Required cards: Woven Flames, Bestest/Tossup. Ideally aim to draw Adeptus/Liu Su as well  
<br></br>
Delayed Agent Adeptus FTK (3-2-9):  
Agent NA > Agent NA/Skill > End turn  
Required cards: Adeptus, Bestest/Tossup  
This line requires you to pre-emptively end so that you go 1st on the following turn.  
<br></br>
Mona Ramp Opener (1-1):  
Swap to Mona (optional, only if you started agent to tank/threaten ftk/Liu  Su) > Mona skill > Paimon/Liben  
Required cards: Paimon/Liben, Bestest/Tossup. Ideally Liu Su.  

 
## Mid Game Plan
Look to punish your opponent overextending and leaving their win conditions vulnerable and threaten to remove or heavily damage them. If all went well your opponent should be very much on the back foot. If not, you still have very big value bombs in Mona's burst into a Vaporize from Klee or Agent, as well as Klee's very strong burst that at bare minimum will alter your opponent's gameplay to avoid losing characters to her passive damage. So long as Klee is able to burst without dying, you will typically find yourself in a winning position.
