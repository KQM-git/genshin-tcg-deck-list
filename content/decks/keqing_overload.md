## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards="['Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames', 'Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames', 'Leave It to Me', 'The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Liu Su']"></CardRow>

Against slower setup decks, like ones centered around Xingqiu, you should aim for cards that provide dice advantage, such as Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames so that you are able to take advantage of Xingqiu's slow setup. Against faster decks, however, cards like Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames and Leave it to Me! are prioritized, letting you match you opponents aggression and potentially enabling an early takedown, as two Elemental Skills combined with Fervent Flames's effect is able to deal 11 DMG to a single opponent!<br><br> 

If you're unsure of the deck's playstyle, some helpful cards for you would be dice fixers (i.e. The Bestest Travel Companion!) and cards that provide Energy like Liu Su. Energy cards help enable powerful Elemental Bursts like Bennett's, and as Keqing's Lightning Stiletto requires Electro dice, dice fixers can help provide the required cost without Elemental Tuning. Should you draw Bennett's Talent card, Grand Expectation, keep it. It is a very powerful card with many benefits.<br><br> 

## Early Game
<CardRow :cards="['Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames','Bennett','Keqing', 'Liu Su']"></CardRow>
There are various opportunities to fell one of your opponent's characters on the first Round, namely by utilizing Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames alongside Keqing's Elemental Skill and one of the Pyro characters' Elemental Skill. Of course, if your opponent switches characters, this technique would not do much.<br><br> 

Alternatives for Round 1 strategies usually begin with Keqing's Elemental Skill. This line is the most common as it provides you with Lightning Stiletto and a variety of ways to continue playing. You may decide to switch to Bennett to try to gain Energy, or play Support Cards to gain advantage.<br><br> 

If you have a bad hand, beginning the game with Fatui Pyro Agent as the active character and setting up is an option, but it is not recommended due to the loss of Lightning Stiletto, meaning Overloads are harder to achieve.<br><br> 

## Mid Game Plan
<CardFan :cards="['Adeptus\' Temptation','Fatui Pyro Agent','Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet']"></CardFan>
Keqing Overload is an aggressive deck that can capitalize on your opponent's misplays harshly. Should they leave an important character vulnerable or spend their Round setting up recklessly, the DMG you can dish out is most likely enough to take out that character. An Elemental Skill boosted by Pyro Resonance, or Fatui Pyro Agent's Elemental Burst boosted by Adeptus' Temptation, will usually deal enough DMG to go through all characters bar few. <br><br> 

After the first few Rounds, you should be at a heavy HP advantage, and your opponent might be missing a character or two. At this point in the game you should attempt to unleash Bennett's Elemental Burst to further this advantage while also keeping yourself healthy, or get out a surprise Elemental Burst from Fatui Pyro Agent to further narrow down your opponent's options. Maintaining Bennett's HP is crucial, as he will be a crucial character should you be at risk. <br><br> 

While it's often important to keep your characters alive, don't be afraid to trade your characters. You can let Agent be defeated after felling your opponent's most important character, for example. Players of this deck must recognize that it prefers to close out games fast, and trading characters is often advantageous.<br><br> 

## Late Game Plan
<CardRow :cards="['Grand Expectation']"></CardRow>
The late game plan relies heavily on Bennett. Because of the deck's rapid and aggressive playstyle, Bennett is often the only source of healing. Because of this, Bennett's Elemental Burst is all the more important, as it lets you absorb more DMG than your opponent in order to clinch victory from a desperate situation. This tactic is even more effective with the Talent Card Grand Expectation, as the DMG bonus provided by Bennett's Inspiration Field is now constantly available.<br><br>
