## Mulligan: 
<CardRow :cards="['Liyue Harbor Wharf ', 'Liben', 'Paimon', 'The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Toss Up']"></CardRow>


MMEC generates advantage over time as the bulk of the damage comes from end of turn Summons. To facilitate that, you want ramp and card draw to either allow you to summon more, or to draw healing cards to allow your Summons to get their value. Ramp are cards that provide you with extra dice advantage, such as Changing Shifts, so they are essential to MMEC's game plan. Dice fixing is very necessary as well, since the dice requirements are very stringent because you don't want to Normal Attack. Keep Paimon, Liben, Liyue Harbor Wharf, and at most one dice fixer (Toss Up or The Bestest Travel Companion).


## Early Game: 


Always start on Rhodeia, and start applying pressure by summoning with your 3 or 5 cost skill. If you have Changing Shifts or Elemental Resonance: Woven Waters in hand as well as a dice fixer, The Myriad Wilds into Nightrider is your preferred opener. However, if you don't manage to have sufficient dice, ramping is your preferred alternative. If you feel unsafe ramping Round 1 on Rhodeia after summoning an Oceanid Mimic, you can swap to Fischl, summon Oz, and swap back to make it less likely that Rhodeia will die. On Round 2, you want to get more Summons out on the field while ensuring that your characters stay alive to gradually build up energy to threaten a lethal burst.


### Mirror Maiden
<CardRow :cards= "['Mirror Maiden']"></CardRow>


Knowing when to swap in Mirror Maiden and using her Elemental Skill is the most difficult part of this deck. On Round 2 and onwards, if you have 2 Hydro Summons alongside Oz, a Refraction applied by an Influx Blast can guarantee lethal DMG on the opponent's active character. This is a great way to punish opponents for ending their Round early, and the opponent will always have to respect the threat of your End Phase damage combined with an Influx Blast.


## Mid/Late Game
<CardFan :cards="['Calx\'s Arts', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet', 'Adeptus\' Temptation',]"></CardFan>


Prioritise maintaining Summon uptime and healing up the team with food cards and Hydro Resonance: Soothing Waters to get out of the opponent's kill range. Cards such as Calx's Arts or I Haven't Lost Yet combined with Adeptus' Temptation can be utilised to surprise opponents with an unexpected DMG spike on an important target. Fischl's Elemental Burst, Midnight Phantasmagoria, can deal a significant amount of AoE damage to help finish off low HP standby characters. On the other hand, Rhodeia's Elemental Burst, Tide and Torrent, can threaten up to 10 DMG with 4 Summons on the field that can close out games. Furthermore, Mirror Maiden's Refraction combined with End Phase Summons will easily close out games as well.


## Tech Options
<CardFan :cards="['Send Off', 'Lucky Dog\'s Silver Circlet', 'Mondstadt Hash Brown',]"></CardFan>


As the deck is flexible, cards may be swapped out if you are facing a particular matchup in a majority of your games. Taking out a General's Ancient Helm for a Lucky Dog's Silver Circlet, as well as adding Mondstadt Hash Brown are options to help against aggressive decks such as Superconduct or Double Pyro. If you are worried about Summons from Sucrose or Ganyu, adding a copy of Send Off will help against those decks. Favonius Cathedral and Knights of Favonius Library are options if playing in a slower stall-like fashion is preferred. Consider replacing a Leave it to Me!, an artifact, or an Adeptus Temptation to fit these tech options.
