## Mulligan: 
<CardRow :cards="['Sumeru City', 'Sapwood Blade', 'Crimson Witch of Flames', 'Opera Epiclese', 'Stormterror\'s Lair']"></CardRow>

Prioritize Sumeru City, Sapwood Blade, Crimson Witch of Flames and Opera Epiclese in your mulligan. These cards take time to gain value making it important to draw them early on. Stormterror's Lair is another card that serves as a ramp that additionally draws the all-important Grand Expectation from your deck. Cards such as Liben and Strategize are flexible options that allow you to comfortably use up your dice Round 1 which allow you to keep impactful cards such as Fresh Wind of Freedom and Leave It to Me! in the mulligan.

## Early Game:
Keqing Overload has 2 different opening lines. The first one involves starting on Bennett and immediately charging up his Elemental Burst, Fantastic Voyage. This allows you to take advantage of the buffs provided by Inspiration Field from Bennett's Elemental Burst as soon as possible. This is the most common line and the opener you should usually be going for. Be mindful of the opponent's options to take out Bennett before he sets up Inspiration Field as it can be quite easy for the opponent to withstand your remaining 2 characters without it.

The second opening line consists of starting with Keqing's Elemental Skill, Stellar Restoration, followed by swapping to Bennett and using a Normal Attack or Elemental Skill. The Electro application provided by Keqing allows you to pressure the opponent with an Overload reaction and comes with the additional advantage of creating a Lightning Stiletto early on. This line is recommended against decks that are very reliant on setting up with their starting character such as against combo decks. 

On round 2, you want to use Bennett's Elemental Burst to start pressuring the opponent by putting them into kill range. The +2 damage from Inspiration Field lets you kill any unit with 2 Elemental Skills, and makes a Keqing Skill deal 7 damage with the Overload reaction. When possible, apply Pyro to characters with no Elemental Aura to set up Keqing with Overload reactions later in the game. Take advantage of the healing from Inspiration Field as much as you can as it will allow you to outvalue the opponent. 

If you started with Keqing and have a lot of ramp in hand, you can delay using Bennett's Elemental Burst until Round 3 if the deck you are facing has insufficient pressure to punish. 

## Mid/Late Game
<CardRow :cards= "['Leave It to Me!', 'Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames', 'Gambler\'s Earrings']"></CardRow>

On Round 3 you generally want to swap to Keqing to pick off characters with a Pyro Aura. You can use Leave It to Me! or Lightning Stilleto to immediately swap to Keqing for a guaranteed Overload reaction. Damage increasing cards like Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames and Tandoori Roast Chicken allow you to take down characters that would otherwise survive with a sliver of HP. Gambler's Earrings is an especially good card to have when trying to push for a win as it provides up to 3 extra dice after you defeat 2 characters.

It is important to keep Keqing alive as she is your only source of Electro, so you can keep her out of harm's way by swapping to Klee or Bennett and later using Lightning Stiletto to swap back at a more opportune time. Klee's ability to discount her Charged Attack allows her to attack 2 times with 5 Dice for an extra push with the buff of Inspiration field. Try to deal as much damage while you have the Inspiration Field Combat Status as the deck is significantly weaker without it.

If the opponent is playing a slower strategy with a lot of sustain, staying on Bennett while taking advantage of the healing from Inspiration Field while continually rebuilding your burst is the strategy. When you find the right opportunity to take down their key character and push for the win, you can grind out your opponent with your value.

## Other Options
<CardRow :cards= "['Thunder Manifestation', 'Covenant of Rock', 'Sacrificial Sword', 'Vorukasha\'s Glow', 'Weeping Willow of the Lake']"></CardRow>

Pyro Keqing is quite flexible when it comes to deck building, letting you pick and choose between the options you want depending on what you want to prepare for. 

Thunder Manifestation can be used over Keqing if you want slightly more damage but removes the option of starting on Keqing as well as not being able to make use of Stormterror's Lair. Lyney can similarly be used over Klee for the same reason but lacks Klee's ability to do 2 actions with 5 dice. 

Covenant of Rock is another Arcane Card that you can use over Fresh Wind of Freedom to potentially get an additional action and works particularly well with Klee's Charged Attack. 

Sacrificial Sword can be used in place of Sapwood Blade to improve your matchups against slower decks but is less flexible overall. You can play an additional Crimson Witch of Flames or replace them with Vorukasha's Glow or Veteran's Visage. The additional sustain and card draw provided by Vorukasha's Glow is useful against aggro decks while Veteran's Visage has the highest potential value but is reliant on opposing attacks and Inspiration Field’s healing to trigger.

Seed Dispensary can be played along with other cheap cards such as Weeping Willow of the Lake and the aforementioned Vorukasha's Glow. Other options such as Vanarana, Mondstadt Hash Brown, The Bestest Travel Companion! can also be considered depending on how you want to build your deck. You can remove Crimson Witch of Flames, Sapwood Blade, Stormterror's Lair, Opera Epiclese, Liben, Strategize and a copy of I Haven’t Lost Yet! for some of these cards.
