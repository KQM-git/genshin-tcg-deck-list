description: Perhaps you’ve been looking for a new powerful deck to master that has a straightforward strategy and can easily sweep your opponents. Well, Geoceanid is for you! The main objective of this deck is to spam summons with Oceanid and threaten your opponent with its burst that deals a significant amount of damage as well as provide crystallize reactions for the Geo characters. Stonehide Lawachurl can also deal a huge amount of DMG with its passive plus geo reactions while Noelle can tank and solo in the late game thanks to her shield skill, geo resonance, and the needed equipment. It’s important to keep Noelle healthy at all times against AoE DMG decks, keep her safe with the healing food cards and you will be able to dominate your opponents in the late game.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Abyssal Summons', 'Starsigns', 'Liben', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf', 'Knights of Favonius Library']"></CardRow>

Oftentimes Abyssal Summons is the best card in your starting hand, as it can summon Pyro, Electro or Cryo hilichurls that synergizes very well with your Oceanid summons and can put even more pressure on the opponent in the early game. Keeping a copy of Starsigns in your hand is suggested to threaten an early Oceanid or Lawachurl Elemental Burst when your opponent is least expecting it. Ramp cards like Paimon, Liben and Liyue Harbor Wharf are also good to keep, so that you can have the advantage over your opponent in the midgame. Lastly, 1 copy dice fixers like The Bestest Traveling Companion! or Knights of Favonius Library is good to avoid having to tune your cards.  <br></br>

If you are up against AoE DMG decks (Superconduct, Anemo Swirls, Electro-charge), Mushroom Pizza or Hash Brown can definitely keep your Noelle healthy and safe until late game.

## The Power of Geoceanid Highroll
<CardFan :cards="['Stonehide Lawachurl', 'Rhodeia of Loch']"></CardFan>

For starters, you always want to start with Oceanid to get summons out with The Myriad Wilds (5 cost skill). If you have Abyssal Summons in hand you want to play that first so that the first 2 summons will cause a elemental reaction while the 3rd summon will apply an elemental aura to that character, this is helpful for setting up geo reactions and potentially setting up crazy elemental reactions with your second Abyssal Summons as your 4th summon.  <br></br>

Oceanid burst is strong with 2+ summons on the field, if you happen to get Starsigns then that’s great for surprising your opponent with big chunk of DMG, if not however, you can use extra dice for setting up supports, equipping Noelle, or swap to Stonehide Lawachurl to get those geo reactions. Its passive is very important because you deal 1 additional DMG and another 1 additional DMG from geo reactions, you want to preserve that so don’t end turn with it unless there are no summons on your opponent’s board.  <br></br>

An alternative approach is to start on Stonehide Lawachurl first. This way, if you have the Geo Woven Dice card, you can threaten to kill the opposing character in the first round (Normal Attack -> Normal Attack -> Woven Dice -> Elemental Burst), as the combo will deal exactly 10 DMG. Even if you do not have the Geo Woven Dice card, your opponent might expect it and be forced to swap out instead of staying on the same character for 1 whole round. This is very effective against units that like to get their Elemental Burst as early as possible like Xingqiu. Don’t worry if you are not able to snipe Xingqiu in the first round when your opponent expects the combo, as you are still able to disrupt their game plan and slow them down, allowing you to set up your own combo and win before them.  <br></br>

If you’re dealing with Double Pyro FTK decks, you can do The Myriad Wilds (5 cost skill) then swap to Stonehide Lawachurl. When the next round comes in you can deal a maximum of 5 DMG with just skill alone or 4 DMG with a normal attack plus you get 1 shield point thanks to geo reactions. If you’re going for this route, then make use of Stonehide Lawachurl’s passive until it gets knocked out, you can also use 1 Geo Resonance to protect it but save the other one for Noelle. Stonehide Lawachurl doesn’t need tons of card protection because you only need to use them for Noelle only and its passive doesn’t last long, when its passive is depleted, it’ll become very weak and unable to cause geo reactions but it can still do 5 DMG burst.

## Time to clean up with Noelle
<CardRow :cards= "['Noelle']"></CardRow>

Once your other characters get eliminated, then it’s time for Noelle to sweep the board! Her shield is what makes her super strong when it comes to stalling, if your Noelle is fully equipped with Wolf’s Gravestone and General Ancient’s Helm/Lucky Dog then you’re pretty much unstoppable. Build her burst with her shields, normal attacking is fine as long as the shield remains intact. Once her energy is maxed out you don’t want to use her burst immediately unless you are in a safe position, you usually burst if it’s lethal. With her burst you can easily sweep your opponents with your normal attacks.  <br></br>

Now what if your Noelle doesn’t have any equipment? Don’t worry as she is steady as stone. With the aid of Geo Resonance alongside with other food cards she can survive even against lethal threats. Pair her with 1 Abyssal Summons and that will give you 1 extra DMG and 1 extra shield point thanks to geo reactions. Chip your opponent’s HP away with just skill and normal attacks then burst to close the game.
